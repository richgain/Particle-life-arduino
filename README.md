Particle life converted from hunar4321's javascript code with some help from ChatGPT

After playing with Tom Mohr's version of Particle Life and then discovering hunar4321's github page, 
I wanted to try and find a version that would run on an ESP32.
I already had a version of John Conway's Game of Life running on my LilyGO ESP32 T-display S3, 
so I strongly suspected it should be possible to get it running. I couldn't find an existing port 
of the code, so, not being a proficient programmer, I decided to try and enlist the help of Chat-GPT.
I have never tried anything like this before but it was a very enjoyable and successful collaboration.

The Particle Life 4 colour version is designed to run on the basic board.
The Particle Life control version is modified to make use of Volos's LilyGO TTGO T-Display development board;
